use_affinity:  false  # This changes the filtering metrics to metrics more amenable to small molecule binder design
filter_cysteine:  false  # [different from peptide-protein] This filters out all designs that have designed cysteins in them (prespecified cysteins in the design are not counted)
from_inverse_folded:  false  # This makes it so that we use the backbone refolding rmsd instead of the all-atom RMSD
filter_bindingsite:  false  # This filters out everything that does not have a residue within 4A of a binding site residue
